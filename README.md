# Solving Differential Problems of Dirichlet and Neumann Type

This repository contains an academic assignment completed as part of the
subject "Equations of Mathematical Physics". The aim was to solve differential
problems of Dirichlet and Neumann type on a ring and a circle using symbolic
computation.


## Description

In this assignment, I explored the use of symbolic computation to solve
differential equations. The code is written in Python and includes an
implementation of the theoretical aspects of solving the Laplace equation in
Dirichlet and Neumann problems on the ring and circle, considering
heterogeneity. Additionally, the repository contains a tutorial from my
instructor that provides a detailed explanation of how to solve these kinds
of problems.


## Contents

- **main.py**: A Python script that includes implementations of symbolic methods
used to solve differential problems.

- **methodology.pdf**: A document containing detailed methodology instructions,
including a thorough description of the problem statement and the algorithm
for solving it.

- **LICENSE**: The license under which the code is distributed.


## Getting Started

To get started with this project, you can simply clone the repository and run
the **main.py** script. Once the script is running, a user-friendly GUI will
appear, allowing you to enter all the initial data required to solve the
problem. You can also refer to the methodology.pdf file for more information
on the problem statement.
